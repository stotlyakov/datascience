Hi Ricardo,  
Thanks for getting back. We did have an incident yesterday that caused a number of customers to experience 520 errors. This issue was due to SSL negotiation failures between Cloudflare and customer's origin servers. Customers using Cloudflare Origin CA and Microsoft IIS servers were most heavily impacted.  
My understanding is that the issue has been addressed and we are no longer seeing errors for customers.  
Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.  
Best regards,
